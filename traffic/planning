tile size: 10m

COL: if 500 collisions every 160 million kilometers, then 1 collision every 30 million tiles 
proof:
5 collisions every 1.6 million kilometers
10 every 3 million
1 every 300000 kilometers
kilometers = 100 tiles
1 collision every 30 million tiles, Q.E.D.


FAT: if .79 fatalities per 160 million kilometers, then 1 fatality every 20 billion tiles

FATCOL: 1 fatality every 1500 collisions (COL, FAT)

unused stats: 124.16 injuries for every 160 million kilometers
